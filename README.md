Machine learning - practical project classification

This project it is about analyzing data from 4 different datasets in order to respond at the question - what factors determine the willingness to stay with the current employer?

Using machine learning classification models, I have to predict whether or not an employee will quit their job.

For this exercise I have to follow the next steps

• Understanding and analyzing the problem represented by the data

• Initial familiarization with the presented data

• Data analysis, visualization and EDA

• Use and test different classification algorithms

• There is a possibility of 3 attempts on the competition set. The highest f1-score will be taken into account.
